Files are uploaded to [Gofile](https://gofile.io/api) which supports anonymous file uploads. But only one file can be uploaded at once. So when a user selects multiple files they are zipped and uploaded as files.zip.

## Install packages

```
pnpm install
```

## Start Dev Server

```
pnpm run dev
```
